# Analog-Clock
A simple anlaog clock application.\
Day 2 of free Javascript 30  course online \
Analog created by a clean simple CSS and JS logic\
Create a simple html clock with three hands (one each,Hour,minute and second)\
for starting let the clock hands be positioned above each other\
change the transfrom -origin property to 100 %( for hand to rotate from its end)\
if you want for aesthetics and good ux you can use  transition-timing-function property(on clock hands) and set it to cubic bezier  to have a lil springy click effect.

## JS part
### Create a function for doing folllowing steps
##### Select hands by DOM manipulation(can be done outside the fn too)
##### find current hour minute and seconds using inbuilt JS functions
##### convert the time from above step to degrees (time/60)*360 for minute and second and (time/12)*360 for hours 
##### rotate the time hand by corresponding degrees

### Call the function created above at regular intervals.

## And Voila You have  an  analog clock ready
